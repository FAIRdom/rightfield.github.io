                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Scientists predominately use spreadsheets for collecting and sharing their data. We recognise
                            this with RightField, and it was the main motivation behind creating it. Scientists using
                            RightField enabled spreadsheet templates can continue to work without changing their
                            practices, and use the same tools they are familiar with.</p>
                        <p>The templates created by RightField are standard vanilla Excel spreadsheets (no special
                            plugins or macros required). The templates can be shared, edited, and reused just like any
                            other spreadsheets. Scientists using the templates never need to be aware of semantic
                            technologies or the ontologies used, or even that they were created using RightField.</p>

                    <h2>For Template Builders</h2>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Data collectors use RightField to generate Excel spreadsheet templates embedded with
                            Ontologies or SKOS vocabularies. Cells can be restricted to use standard controlled
                            vocabularies related to the particular research area, and/or can be marked up to indicate
                            their meaning.</p>
                        <p>These templates can then be distributed and shared amongst scientists, and later collect the
                            data and annotations as either RDF or using a CSV format. </p>
                        <p>The semantic information, and its provenance, is all held within the generated template and
                            does not require additional mappings or files to be created and stored for later
                            extraction.</p>
